smalldatasf was a big hit! I spent the last two days challenging my own assumptions and thinking differently about data. I attended the workshops, the sessions, and had many intellectually stimulating conversations with some of the sharpest minds in data. 

Here are my notes:

Start with the small data manifesto
https://www.smalldatasf.com/2024/#manifesto

First on the workshops:
1. dbt and Motherduck - Thanks to Jacob Matson for showing how easy it is to get started with dbt and motherduck. https://github.com/MotherDuck-Open-Source/dbt-tutorial-template
2. data apps with evidence.dev - I was drawn to the simplicity of evidence's approach with sql and markdown to create beautiful data apps and finally had a chance to build and what better way than with guidance from Adam McAskill and Sean Hughes. https://github.com/evidence-dev/sf311_starter

The sessions were fantastic:
1. Glauber Costa from Turso shared an alternative approach to building apps or provisioning data products: "Given every user their own database"
2. Live demo from Jeffrey Morgan of Ollama running your own small models and especially with small data. I have written about this too:

3. Lindsay Murphy talked about constraints and how they can foster innovation + allow data teams to demonstrate ROI
4. Benn Stancil's session on BI's big lie was perhaps the most entertaining. So much so that I forgot to take notes but he said something about "unlocking value from data" - the magic selling formula that every BI vendor uses. And some history about Target, Moneyball, data scientists, etc.
5. Gaurav Saxena on TPC benchmarks and how they compare to real world workloads. Checkout the published data and research https://github.com/amazon-science/redset https://www.amazon.science/code-and-datasets/redset Snowflake released a similar dataset a while ago
6. Richard Wesley on the evolution of databases, compute, and BI tools. He knows what he is talking about, he is at DuckDB labs and was an early contributor to Tableau.
7. Chris Laffra shared his ambitious pysheets project bringing spreadsheets to Python - check it out https://pysheets.app/
8. George Fraser and Jordan Tigani talked about data workloads, ingest to datalakes, and open table formats.
9. Gilad Lotan from Buzzfeed on datascience at scale
10. Junran Yang shared her research in data visualization toolkits
11. Finally, Ravit moderated a panel on big data vs small data and delivering business value with Jake Thomas, Celina Wong, James Winegar, Josh Wills

Other highlights:
- impromptu interview with Ravit
- catching up with Zack Handlin on how Zing is integrating GenAI into the UI and the whole AI in BI revolution
- Mingsheng on how data orgs should approach duckdb and small data
- Felipe Hoffa on careers and doing what you love
- Talking to George Fraser on the Fivetran roadmap, licensing, and working with the Marketo APIs

Thanks to Motherduck, Ollama, Turso, and others for the great event.
